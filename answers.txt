1: Describing Library Routines
    dup2: This will duplicate a file descriptor (an integer in the kernel that 
        points to a file) between two specified file descriptors; for example, 
        this can be used to append stdout messages to a file.
    creat: This will create a new file that can be written to; if the file 
        exists, it will be truncated to 0 length.
    pipe: This will create a pipe between two processes, allowing them to 
        communicate; this is very similar to piping in bash, where output from 
        one command will pipe as input to another.
    fork: Creates a new process (child), which is a copy of the current 
        process (parent); these can share some resources with each other.
    pthread_create: Creates a new thread that executes a specified function; 
        this is useful for modern CPUs that can run multiple threads at once.
    system: Executes the given shell command; this is done as a child process 
        created with fork.
    printf: Prints the provided string to stdout; this is useful for console 
        processes as a means to display output to users.

2: Last line of invokeCmd:
    The invokeCmd checks to ensure that the required arguments are given.  If 
        these checks pass, the final line in invokeCmd will pass the given 
        arguments to the relevant function relating to the given command, as 
        defined by cmdTable.
